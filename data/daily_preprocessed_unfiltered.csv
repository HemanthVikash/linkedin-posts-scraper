However, the focus should be on market-ready applications solving specific problems. Many new companies risk overhyping their capabilities, leading to disappointment and a loss of consumer trust in AI.

The stakes can feel enormous, and nobody wants to be left behind by their rivals. Companies across industries are testing generative AI to make their workforces more productive, communicate with customers, or improve financial forecasting. Companies are gauging returns using metrics such as productivity gains and employee satisfaction, as well as revenue. But the technology can also come with a multimillion-dollar price tag for companies spending money on infrastructure, staff and partnerships with software providers. Companies can pay to use proprietary models from providers such as OpenAI, or they can also build their own generative AI tools using open-source models, such as Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 AI model. Motorola is testing potential applications for generative AI using models the company purchased from software providers to summarize complex industry contracts and helping software developers with tasks such as writing first drafts of code. Airbnb‚Äôs CFO and CTO are trying to prioritize among possible experiments with generative AI to improve customer service, a critical area for the company. It is also using computer-vision models to help automatically identify photos and use machine learning to help guests find listings that match their needs. Airbnb has been leaning in to see where they can leverage AI to just make the kind of matching of problem and solution more straightforward, more efficient and get to better outcomes. Intuit is using and testing generative AI across its product lines to help answer customer questions or generate invoice reminders. Some of the AI-driven features Intuit has introduced for its customers are expected to provide the company with pricing power over time. Companies also could face additional costs if they had to switch from an AI platform that didn‚Äôt pan out, particularly if they have a high volume of contracts. But finance chiefs won‚Äôt be able to fully gauge the value of an AI tool until they give it a shot. And the return on AI could also improve with use. Software company Autodesk is also looking for possible uses of generative AI within the finance team itself. It is already applying the technology to help with forecasting and identifying patterns in customers‚Äô consumption of cloud services, which allows Autodesk to predict its own future cloud costs. As AI is more widely used across the finance team the department‚Äôs hiring costs may change. If companies can automate some of the processes that underpin the ability for those more strategic finance people to be successful, they might be hiring fewer people on an incremental basis in the long-term. #ai #aiinvestment",,,,,,The Wharton School,United States,"Entre Familia Greater Boston Food Bank Food Pantry, 211, River Street, Mattapan Heights, Mattapan, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, 02126, United States"

This episode talks about the 'reality' created by quantum computing. And it got me thinking about our very favorite mythical AI within the job search. See I believe that those of you who truly and genuinely believe that AI is hiding your resume from humans are living on level 1 of this reality. Nothing we as recruiters can say and do to tell you the true reality will change your mind. Here is the big thing about AI within the hiring process. It's not yet AI! Not the way people think of AI! At best it's Machine Learning and at it's simplest it's automation. And to be clear automation is a small part of AI and Machine Learning. But genuinely I'm tired of this argument. If you want to believe in an AI, you do that. Anyone peddling that they can teach you how to beat the AI in the job process is... This job market is awful and people are getting scammed left and right. However, just like Annie Murphy had to break the quantum computer herself to pull out of her false reality, you too will have to do the same. Most of the time, the AI calibration is about making sure that your resume is telling the other side how you're qualified using the words that are listed in the job description.

They are proud of their soical conscience, they prize convenience and have expensive tastes.  They crave authenticity and being creative is always at their fingertips. So,  Are Gen Zs the next Gen AI? According to this great survey by EduBirdie ,  49% of Gen Z respondents acknowledge that gen AI drives more creativity, productivity, and boosted their confidence at work and socially.  For Gen Zs, ChatGPT enabled them to earn more money. Gen Z mainly uses ChatGPT for - Researching (61%) - Generating ideas and brainstorming (56%) - Writing and generating content (42%) - Refining¬†their resumes¬†and applications to stand out in the hiring process (23%) With on-demand machine learning and automation, will AI take over jobs?  Gen Zs dabbling with gen AI ( with mixed emotions) are demonstrating that rather than worried AI taking jobs,  this generation is well positioned to demonstrate how to be more creative and productive with gen AI.   We are starting to see gen AI automate mundane tasks and free up humans  to be more human - more creative, more innovative.

Let's keep the tech talk going in talent acquisition! Today, we're breaking down machine learning (ML). ML is all about systems that learn from data, spot patterns, and make decisions with little human input. Take LinkedIn, for example. Ever notice how it suggests jobs that seem tailor-made for you? That's ML at work, not just looking at your skills but also learning from how you interact on the platform. Pretty cool, right? But here's the thing: ML isn't perfect. Sometimes it can pick up biases, like Amazon's CV screening tool favoring male candidates. That's why we need to keep a close eye on it to ensure fairness. If you're vetting a work-tech vendor, here's a question to ask: ""How does your system handle new data? Can it tweak its candidate selection based on past hiring outcomes?"" #worktech #machinelearning #informedecisions",,,,"6,976",,Informed Decisions,◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú,"◊™◊ú ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ë-◊ô◊§◊ï, ◊†◊§◊™ ◊™◊ú ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ë, ◊û◊ó◊ï◊ñ ◊™◊ú ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ë, ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú"

It has set its sights on harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to transform the way we interact, create, work, and live. ‚Ä¢	Innovations and Integrations We‚Äôve seen Siri revolutionize voice control. We‚Äôre now witnessing on-device AI and machine learning applications integrated into each new product launch. These aren't just features; they are redefining user interfaces. What excites me is the shift in Apple's approach to AI. Once considered secretive, Apple is beginning to open up - sharing research papers, joining partnership on AI, and increasingly hiring top AI talent. It's a turning point that signifies commitment - a commitment towards progressing AI not just within Apple, but within the entire technology industry. ‚Ä¢	The Challenge However, the road to dominance isn't smooth. Google's deep learning capabilities and Amazon's mastery in practical AI applications set the competitive stage. And yet, with its traditional focus on user privacy, Apple finds itself in a unique position to establish a new AI paradigm. ‚Ä¢	Benefitting the Consumers Imagine a world where AI isn‚Äôt just a tool, but an integral part of life - assisting, predicting, and simplifying tasks while respecting and protecting user privacy. This is the world Apple is trying to craft with their AI work. Now, isn't it exciting to think about where we are heading? The real value of AI lies not just in intelligent machines, but in augmenting human potential and capabilities. With their user-centric vision, Apple‚Äôs foray into AI could really change our perception and use of technology.

As we delve into the latest trends and innovations, it's clear that the hiring process is undergoing a transformation that promises significant benefits for both candidates and clients. The Digital Revolution in Recruitment üåê The rise of AI and machine learning is revolutionising the way we identify and attract top talent. For clients, these technologies mean more efficient screening processes and the ability to predict candidate success with greater accuracy. Candidates, on the other hand, experience a more personalised job search, with algorithms that match them to roles that align with their skills and aspirations. The Power of Employer Branding üíº A strong employer brand has never been more important. Clients who invest in their reputation not only attract higher quality candidates but also see increased retention rates. For candidates, a company with a clear and compelling employer brand signals a workplace where they can thrive and align their values. Embracing Flexibility and Remote Work üè° The shift towards remote work has opened doors for candidates seeking flexibility and work-life balance. Clients benefit from a wider talent pool, no longer limited by geographical constraints, and can tap into a diverse range of skills and perspectives. The Human Touch in Tech-Driven Recruitment ü§ù Despite technological advances, the human element remains vital. Emotional intelligence and soft skills are becoming key differentiators for candidates. Clients who prioritise these attributes in their hiring criteria are more likely to build resilient and adaptable teams. The Rise of Skills-Based Hiring üõ†Ô∏è The focus on skills rather than just qualifications is a boon for candidates, allowing them to showcase their capabilities and potential. Clients gain by accessing talent with the exact skill set needed, often uncovering hidden gems in the process. In conclusion, the synergy between these trends and innovations is creating a more dynamic, inclusive, and efficient hiring landscape. By embracing these changes, both candidates and clients stand to gain immensely, heralding a new era of talent acquisition where everyone has the opportunity to succeed. #TalentAcquisition #HiringTrends #InnovationInRecruiting",,,,,,iRecruit Partners Ltd,,

I was in 120%. The little green ‚ÄòOpen to Work‚Äô banner will soon disappear. More about that soon‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs been satisfying, exhausting and frustrating. I‚Äôm sharing my experience to improve job searching for candidates and hiring managers: 1. Lower your expectation about using LinkedIn to find a role: I know a couple of people that have found theirs here but 8/10 organisations do not reply, there‚Äôs no indication they‚Äôve read your CV, and even when you‚Äôre flagged as a ‚Äòtop applicant‚Äô, a machine is likely doing the triage. Go direct to the hiring manager and introduce yourself. If you‚Äôre advertising through LI, make sure there‚Äôs a feedback loop or don‚Äôt do it. 2. That said‚Ä¶ If you do tout ‚ÄòI‚Äôm hiring‚Äô, you‚Äôve got to follow though. Two posters I contacted about salary range or to apply directly said that they weren‚Äôt authorised to discuss and to contact HR. Fail. If a hiring manager can‚Äôt represent their role, it says everything you need to know about company bureaucracy, and kicks a big dent in a corporate brand. I‚Äôll remember the names of those firms for the wrong reasons. 3. Your network is everything, but be careful about contacting ex-colleagues you worked with a while ago. They‚Äôll see you in a box, and not one that reflects the development and experience you‚Äôve had since. One ex-boss told me they didn‚Äôt have anything for a JD I‚Äôd moved away from 12 years ago. 4.  We can debate the back to the office move, but it really does limit the talent pool. I‚Äôve worked remotely for almost eight years, and hybrid for a further seven years. I always been able to co-parent dependent children and nail my work in an international team. Commuting two hours to sit in an office and talk to (another) international team through Zoom makes no sense. Stronger culture and communication win every time over presenteeism. 5. People don‚Äôt know you exist until you put yourself in front of them. I flew to #MWC2024 , door stepped and went direct to CEOs in my sector. Not everyone was hiring. Your timing might be out. But you‚Äôll make a ton of new contacts, that will remember you for the future. 6. Your bills, your mortgage and the children you need to feed are not top of anyone‚Äôs agenda but your own. Contacts mean well when they say they‚Äôll help, but you have to hustle and keep it up. NB: Recruiters are also lovely, but unless they have a a specific role it‚Äôs unlikely they can help. 7. If you‚Äôve got the luxury of a few weeks, do some professional education. It‚Äôs productive and reflects well. I‚Äôve done courses conversion optimisation, and a wonderful MMC Learning course in generative AI. Definitely a good use of time. Big love to my network that went the extra mile, and to all of the contacts that were generous enough to offer me an opportunity. #LinkedInJobs #MarketingDirectorJobs #CMO #TelecomsJobs",58.0,7.0,1.0,,,Strongarm Marketing Communications,United Kingdom,"London, Greater London, England, United Kingdom"

So tell me then‚Ä¶ How are you going to know that you are hiring the right person to clean if you don‚Äôt know how to do it yourself?‚Äù- THE POWER OF LIFELONG LEARNING I found a mentor in a Cuban colleague who showed me everything he had learned about pattern making, fit, draping and design. He would tell me that one day I would outgrow his teachings and move on to better opportunities as long as I never stopped learning Everything happened as he said, and even though I lost him two years ago‚Ä¶ I think of him every time I teach pattern making to a student, passing down his legacy. HOW TO FOCUS AND USE MINDSET I learned to roll with the punches in a very literal way while devoting 5 years to Muay Thai Kickboxing. My coach had trained as a competitive Royal Fighter and I learned to apply the mindset techniques we learned during sparring as he would often say -‚ÄúIf you focus on making decisions to defend yourself as your opponent is punching, kicking and trying to knock you out.. You don't have time to get distracted by the pain!‚Äù- BTW, he‚Äôs in his 70s and still training MMA fighters Don‚Äôt forget!

It's not just a catchy phrase, it's a cold, hard fact. Studies have shown that manufacturing floors committed to continuous learning see productivity spikes by up to 50%. Close-mindedness in manufacturing is like refusing to use a CAD program because you're nostalgic for drafting tables‚Äîcomforting, maybe, but you'll be left in the dust by competitors drafting in 3D. When we slam shut the door on learning, we might as well hang up a sign that says ""Gone Out of Business."" The game-changers in this industry are the ones who see a new technology or method not as a threat, but as an invitation to play in a bigger, bolder league. When machine shops clamp down on the old ways, they're turning a blind eye to the brilliance of progress. On the flip side, shops that swing open the gates to innovation find themselves in a renaissance of efficiency and growth. They become powerhouses of productivity, champions of change, the rock stars in a world that used to praise only the steady hum of conformity.

I was 38. The transition from lawyer to engineer¬† was the BEST (and hardest) thing I‚Äôve ever done. ¬† But‚Ä¶there were mistakes. I guess, looking back, my only regret is that I made so many mistakes - even though I knew better. I just tried to ‚Äúnegotiate‚Äù with life. I lost. And I kept losing till I finally stopped negotiating and just ‚Äúpaid the damn price‚Äù for my dreams. Truth is,¬† had I not made these mistakes I would have been a professional coder much earlier‚Ä¶ probably in 2014 or 2015. Instead, it was only in 2019 that I finallllllllly managed it. Here are the big mistakes I made between 2012 (when I first tried to learn to code) and 2019.: 1. ¬†I focused on learning languages and chasing the newest tools/frameworks. I should have ignored all the noise and focused on fundamentals 2.  I focused on Data Structures & Algorithms too early and way too much. They‚Äôre far less useful for newbies than the internet makes us believe. 3.  I cheated myself of progress for 4 years by trying to ‚Äúfigure it out on my own‚Äù. Had I hired my coach 4 years earlier I would have become a coder 4 years earlier. 4.  I had the wrong expectations - I mistakenly thought that being a coder was about writing code.¬† Had I asked the right questions and had a better plan, I would have realised it‚Äôs still ‚Äúmanufacturing products and services‚Äù ‚Äì but instead of machine tools, we use software tools. 5.  I assumed that learning the coding skills is all it takes to get job offers. This was really stupid of me. Having been on the hiring side I already knew that wasn‚Äôt true.¬† I just fell into a ‚Äúcandidate‚Äôs‚Äù mindset rather than the hirer‚Äôs mindset.¬† Career change is FAR more complex than just learning the ‚Äúbasics‚Äù. Those mistakes cost me FIVE lost years of opportunity. That is a big price to pay for mistakes.¬† 5 years out of a 40 year career is 12.5%. Big price. So I hope that you don‚Äôt make the same mistakes.¬† Because we all run out of time ‚Äì we just don't know when. #careerchange #softwareengineer",366.0,26.0,4.0,"14,386",,Chainlink Labs,Australia,"Melbourne, City of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"

Just two weeks away from celebrating my first half-year anniversary as a Data Scientist at Best Buy, I was impacted by the recent mass layoff. This news hit hard, especially given the current job market and my situation on an F1-OPT work visa. However, I am incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support I have received from colleagues and friends at work. Their kindness and affirmation of my contributions meant the world to me, helping me regain my positivity and sense of empowerment. During my tenure at Best Buy, I supported both the Customer Care and Reverse Supply Chain teams. Collaborating with my colleagues, we spearheaded Natural Language Processing and Large Language Model projects to enhance efficiency in topic mining and text classification on unstructured data. Leveraging my skills in SQL, Python, Machine Learning, Large Language Models, GenerativeAI, and statistical knowledge, I derived valuable business insights. I also honed my leadership and communication skills by innovating side projects on dynamic store planning and delivering presentations on GenerativeAI to diverse audiences within the organization. Though my journey at Best Buy was cut short, the experience and knowledge gained will be invaluable throughout my professional journey. Additionally, I also had prior hands-on experiences working on marketing data science projects including customer segmentation, recommender systems, pricing models, as well as experimentations. As I navigate this transition while on an F1-OPT visa, I have a limited window of time to find my next opportunity. I am actively seeking roles as a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Business Intelligence Analyst, or Business Analyst. If you are aware of any positions aligned with my skills or know someone who may be hiring, I would greatly appreciate your assistance in connecting me. To my former colleagues at Best Buy, thank you for the incredible journey. Though our time together was brief, I cherish the moments that we shared, and I am hoping that our paths will cross again one day. To all my connections, your support means the world to me during this challenging time.

This is expected given the increasing use of ML models to support decision-making in high-stakes applications such as mortgage lending, hiring, and diagnosis in healthcare. Trustworthy AI aims to provide an explainable, robust, and fair decision-making process. In addition, transparency and security also play a significant role in improving the adoption and impact of ML solutions. Currently, most ML models assume ideal conditions and rely on the assumption that test/clinical data comes from the same distribution of the training samples. However, this assumption is not satisfied in most real-world applications; in a clinical setting, we can find different hardware devices, diverse patient populations, or samples from unknown medical conditions. On the other hand, we need to assess potential disparities in outcomes that can be translated and exacerbated in our ML solutions. Particularly, data and models are often imported from external sources in addressing solutions in developing countries, thereby risking potential security issues. The inconsistency between the data and model with the population at hand also poses a lack of transparency and explainability in the decision-making process. This workshop aims to bring researchers, policymakers, and regulators together to discuss ways to ensure security and transparency while addressing fundamental problems in developing countries, particularly when data and models are imported and/or collected locally with less focus on ethical considerations and governance guidelines. ‚ùó Relevant topics ‚ú® Transparency, explainability, interpretability in ML models. ‚ú® Security and privacy concerns in ML models. ‚ú® Misinformation detection. Data poisoning and adversarial examples. ‚ú® Audit techniques for data and ML models. ‚ú® Fairness and exclusion studies (benchmarks and datasets). ‚ú® Evaluation for ensuring fair outcomes for all, especially underrepresented groups. ‚ú® Robustness, safety, and collective value alignment, with a specific interest in measures that support developing countries and underrepresented communities. ‚ú® Social good, participatory AI, and applications of the above principles to different domains (e.g. healthcare, loans, legal). üìú Instructions If you‚Äôre interested in presenting your work, please submit a 4-page paper (4 pages for content and 2 for references) following the IJCAI Author Kit format at https://lnkd.in/ePuQB7Sb .
